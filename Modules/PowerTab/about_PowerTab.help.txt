SHORT DESCRIPTION
    PowerTab extends the tab expansion feature of PowerShell to offer more
    productivity for PowerShell users.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Tab expansion is a productivity feature of PowerShell similar to
    intellisense. Pressing the TAB key will cause PowerTab to suggest full
    paths, command names or values based on the current context of the cursor.

    PowerTab offers handling for many common features of PowerShell, such as
    parameter names or enum values. PowerTab also contains extension points
    for adding specialized tab expansion support for third party applications
    and commands.


  GETTING STARTED
      PowerTab is packaged as a PowerShell module and can simply be imported
      after being saved to one of the locations of modules in
      $env:PSModulePath.

          Import-Module PowerTab

      With no arguments, PowerTab will offer to run the setup wizard which will
      help setup a location to save the PowerTab config file. The config file
      is required to persist configuration settings for PowerTab, and cached
      values for .NET type, WMI class and computer name expansion.


  LOAD POWERTAB WITH AN EXISTING CONFIG
      To load an existing conifig file into PowerTab, pass in the full path to
      the config file as the first argument when importing the PowerTab module.

          $Path = "C:\Users\Bob\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\PowerTabConfig.xml"
          Import-Module PowerTab -ArgumentList $Path
